# Transformer Chatbot

This project implements a Transformer-based chatbot using TensorFlow 2.0 and the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus. The chatbot is capable of generating natural responses based on movie dialogues using the Transformer architecture, a state-of-the-art model for sequence-to-sequence tasks such as language generation.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a chatbot using the Transformer architecture, which is well-suited for tasks requiring long-range dependencies, such as dialogue generation. We utilize TensorFlow 2.0 to implement the Transformer model and preprocess the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus to train the model. The chatbot generates responses based on input sequences by leveraging multi-head attention and positional encodings.

## Model Architecture

The chatbot uses the Transformer model, which consists of:

- **Encoder**: Processes input sentences using multi-head attention and feed-forward layers.
- **Decoder**: Generates output sentences based on encoded input and previously generated tokens.
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence at different layers.
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds information about the position of words in the sentence.

The model is built using TensorFlow's Functional API for better customization and flexibility.

## Dataset

The chatbot is trained on the **Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus**, which contains a rich set of conversations extracted from movie scripts. The dataset includes character dialogues, movie titles, and other metadata.

## Preprocessing

Preprocessing steps include:

- Loading the dataset.
- Cleaning the text (removing special characters, normalizing).
- Tokenizing the dialogues.
- Creating input-output pairs for training.

## Training

The model is trained using the following parameters:

- **Batch Size**: Adjust according to the available memory.
- **Learning Rate**: Implemented using a custom learning rate schedule.
- **Number of Epochs**: The number of times the model will iterate over the training dataset.

## Evaluation

Evaluation metrics include:

- Loss: Monitored during training.
- Accuracy: Evaluated on a separate validation dataset.

## Usage

To use the chatbot:

1. Install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
